# Plate Date

# Overview 🌎
Plate Date is a dynamic menu scheduling application that enables managers to create and share weekly menus with employees. The goal of Plate Date is to allow users to seamlessly schedule unique menu items while accounting for different allergies. All dishes are displayed live on the main page with the dates, ingredients, and calories listed.

    - An intuitive layout with button based features, all seamlessly integrated into a SPA (single-page-application) design. 🕹️

  - Schedule button 🟢
    
    - When clicked the schedule button will open a user window with additonal features
      -  The date sub-feature allows the user to schedule a week for the weekly menu, if no date is entered a preset week will be                         selected (the current week in the users time zone). 🗓️
        
      -  The days off sub-feature will allow the user to select days off on the weekly menu. 📆
        
      -  The generate menu button will create a weekly menu with dates and days off (specified in the schedule window), as well as          allergies (specified from the allergies window). All changes will be rendered live on the front screen. ✅

      -  The submit button will register the allergies selected and subsequently alter the menu, omitting dishes that conflict with any                   allergies that are submitted. The submit button also auto generates a menu and week date (to the current week) if they are not already           scheduled in the schedule window. ✅
